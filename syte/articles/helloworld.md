Hello world!

I have set up this page to have a place to do some blogging.


I intend to write some blogs to get some publicity for the
[Haskell-Python](http://bitbucket.org/cfbolz/haskell-python) project.
Haskell-Python is an attempt to implement Haskell with RPython, to see if
purely functional and lazy languages, e.g. Haskell, can benefit from
just-in-time compilation.


This site is created with [Syte](http://rigoneri.github.com/syte/), but I have
added everything except the GitHub page. These can be found as the following
branches on [my Syte fork](https://github.com/eventh/syte):

* Projects page: [ohloh-integration](http://github.com/eventh/syte/tree/ohloh-integration)
* Bitbucket page: [bitbucket](http://github.com/eventh/syte/tree/bitbucket) (merged upstream)
* Documents page: [documents](http://github.com/eventh/syte/tree/documents)
* About page: [about-page](http://github.com/eventh/syte/tree/about-page)


I have modified Syte to enable memcache and serve static content from Amazon
S3. In the near future I might write a blog post explaining how you can do so
yourself.


Any other changes I have made to Syte can be found in the
[eventh branch](http://github.com/eventh/syte/tree/eventh).
